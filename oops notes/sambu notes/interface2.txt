Example 2
---------
class inheriting multiple interface.


	The diamond problem is solved by implementing multiple interface by the class at a time.


Reason
------
* Non static methods are not implemented in an interface.
* Static method are not inherited.


example 3
---------
class can inherit interface and class at a time.


Rule
----
Use the extends first and then implements.

Notes
-----
	Class can inherit multiple interface but it can't inherit multiple class at a time.

	Interface can't inherit a class.

















How to create static methods?
-----------------------------


Notes
-----
Inherit can't herit from the class.

Reason
------
	class has concrete non static method, so class can't be a parent to the interface.

Notes
-----
Inside the interface constructor and multi line initializer not allowed.


Type of interface
-----------------
* Interface can by classified into 3 types.
	*Regular
	*functional interface
	*Marker interface / Empty interface /tag interface.


1. The interface which contain more than one abstract method then it is known as Regular interface.
	example: Collection interface, map interface.

2. The interface which contain only one abstract method then it is known as functional interface.

3. The interface which don't have any abstract method then it is known as marker interface/ empty interface /tag interface.
