variable shadowing
------------------

	If superclass and subclass having variables with the same name but different values then it is known as variable shadowing.

	Variable shadowing is applicable for both static and non static variables.

	To achieve variable shadowing Is-A-Relationship is mandatory.

	In variable shadowing always we are getting the output based on the reference type variable shadowing is also known as Variable hiding.


Method shadowing
----------------
* If super class and sub class having methods with the same signature but different implementation then it known as method shadowing.

* Method shadowing is applicable for only static methods.

* To achieve method shadowing Is-A-Relationship is mandatory.

* In method shadowing always we are getting the output based on the reference type method shadowing is also known as method hiding.










Run Time Polymorphism
---------------------
* If the binding is achieve at the run time the it i known as run time polymorphism.

* In run time polymorphism always decision is taken by the J.V.M.

* To achieve runtime Polymorphism we are using method overriding concept.

case 1:
	without achieve method override concept.
	----------------------------------------



method Overriding
-----------------
* If super class and sub class having non static methods with the same signature but different  implementation then it is known as method overriding.

* Method overriding is applicable for only non static methods.

* To achieve method overriding Is-A-Relationship is mandatory.

* In Method overriding always we are getting the output based on the object types.

case 2:
	with method overriding concept.
	-------------------------------


notes
-----
	While achieve method overriding, the visibility of child class method should be higher or equal to the parent class method.
