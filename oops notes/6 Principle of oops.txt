Principle of Oops
-----------------
1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction


what is encapsulation?
----------------------
* The process of rapping states and behavior together is called encapsulation.

how to achieve?
---------------
* In java we can achieve encapsulation with the help of class.
				       ----------------------




Access Modifier
---------------
+ public 
- private
  default 
# protected
	
	We can use them with
	--------------------
		* class
		* Variable
		* Methods
		* Constructor


Advantages of Encapsulation
---------------------------
* The main advantage of encapsulation is data hiding.
* We can achieve data hiding with the help private access modifier.
					   -------

what is private?
----------------
* It is a keyword
* It is a also a Access Modifier.
* Any member which is prefixes with private is having visibility only with in the class.
* We cannot access private member out side the class.


Can we Access private resource with in the class?
-------------------------------------------------\
Yes.



what is data hiding?
--------------------
* The process restricting direct access by providing indirect access , secured access, verified and validated access through the helper method is called data hiding.


character getter()
------------------
* Access modifier should be public.
* It should be non static method.
* It should have the return type same as the datatype which is hided.
* It should be no argument method.
* We create get her method to make a data readable.

character setter()
------------------
* Access Modifier should be public.
* It should be non static method.
* It should have return type void.
* It should be parameterized methods.
* We should create set() to make the data member readable.


What is singleton class?
------------------------
* The class which allows only one object creation is called as singleton class.
* It is being use in the field of database and multithreading / multithreads.


what is java Bean class and pojo class?
---------------------------------------
* A class which follow the below give rules is called pojo class.
* It should be public class.
* It should be have private data member.
* It should have public constructor which is no argument.
* It should have public setter and getter.


Encapsulation Important Question
