Is-a relationship
-----------------
* The connection between the object which is similar to parent and child relationship is called as Is-a relationship.

What is inheritance?
--------------------
* The process of acquiring states and behaviour of one object into another object is called as inheritance.
* In java we can achieve inheritance by using the keyword such as:-
	1. extends
	2. implement

Types of inheritance
--------------------
* Single inheritance
* Multi inheritance
* hierarchical inheritance
* multiple inheritance
* hybrid inheritance

single inheritance
------------------
	Inheritance of only one level is called as single level inheritance.

multi level inheritance
--------------------
	Inheritance of more than one level is known as multi level inheritance.

hierarchical inheritance
------------------------
	If a parent(super class) has more than are child(sub class) at these same level then it is known as hierarchical inheritance.

multiple inheritance
--------------------
	If a subclass(child) has more than one parent (super class) the its is know as multiple inheritance.
	
	In java with respect to class we cannot achieve multiple inheritance.(we get diamond problem)

	But we can achieve with help of interface.

Hybrid Inheritance
------------------
	The combination of multiple inheritance and hierarchical inheritance is known as hybrid inheritance.

	All the inheritance is hybrid inheritance we can achieve hybrid inheritance some case and can not achieve some case.(if multiple inheritance involved).

can we inherit static variable?
-------------------------------
Yes, we can inherit.
