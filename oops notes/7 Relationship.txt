Relationship 
------------
	The Connection between the object is called as relationship.
	We can classified relationship into 2 type based on the type of relation.
	1> has-a relationship
	2> Is-a relationship



Has-a relationship
------------------
* The Connection between the object where Dependency Exist is called Has-a-relationship.
			or

* The Dependency between the object is called as Has-a-relationship.

	eg:-(real time example) 

	car-engine
	fish-water
	remote-battery
	human-oxygen
	school-student

	Has-a-Relationship
	------------------
		|
		|--->level of dependency

	-------------------
	|		  |
   Composition	    Aggregation


* Based on the level of dependency we classified Has-a relation into two types:-
	1.Composition
	2.Aggregation


Composition
-----------
* The dependency between the object is in such a way one object can not exists without another object called as Composition.
* In java we can achieve composition with the help of early instantiation.


What is early instantiation?
----------------------------
* It is a process where one object is created inside another and initialize in a same line.


notes
-----

* We can represent composition by as symbol.
	 /\
	/##\_______________________
	\##/		composition
	 \/


Aggregation
-----------
* The dependency between the object is in such a way that one object can exists without another object is called as Aggregation.
* We can achieve Aggregation by using lazy instantiation technique.

	eg:-
	mobile-sim
	cup-coffee
	paper-pen
	bike-kicker
	bill-dishes.

symbol
------

	 /\
	/  \___________________
	\  /	    Aggregation
	 \/



What is lazy instantiation?
---------------------------
* The process where the object which is present inside another object can be initialize according to the programmer wish.
* Here we achieve initialization by using method.



Is-a Relationship
-----------------
	The Connection between the object which is similar to parent and child relationship  is called as Is-a-relationship.
